# Text Based Adventure Game

Built a complete, interactive game in my own genre using JavaSCript and HTML5+CSS3.  Used structured program constructs such as conditionals, loops, and function.  Also used elementary object-oriented principles of objects and method design.  Employed "good coding style"; e.g., comments, spacing and indentation, and mnemonic variable names.

## Implemented Gameplay Standards

1. Events or changes in the state of the game are reported via text dynamically updated on the page
2. User provides text input via the keyboard and a text box
3. At any point in the game, the user has at least two choices
4. The world/map contains several locations for the user to explore

## Implemented Coding Standards
1. Demonstrated a variety of statements and control structures
2. Used a variety of small functions to accomplish specific tasks
3. Oranized related code into libraries
4. Represented logical entities as specific program objects
5. Used a 2D Array to manage the links between locations/rooms
6. Used mnemonic identifiers
7. Code was self-documented as much as possible to explain the design
